# ASP.NET Core (MVC) Form Template

## Description
I have created a template webpage that includes a form being submitted to a Microsoft SQL Server (Express) database. The form input is validated server side when being submitted, and I have also included frontend validation with messages for the user. Additionally, this webpage was made to be responsive and work on both desktop and mobile devices. <br>

Upon getting the frontend visuals and form submission to the database completed, I spent some time reading into Microsoft's SQL Server Management Studio and practiced exporting the database information. With SQL Server Management Studio I was able to export the database with all of its columns/rows into a text file for a quick reference; furthermore, I was able to export the entire schema and user data in native format by exporting it as a .bacpac file so that it was shareable and could be later imported back into a Azure SQL Database or any SQL Server instance.
